KiCad resources to help create designs using the Raspberry Pi MCUs

This provides the Pico and the RP2040 library & footprint files respectively.

Keep these files out of the KiCad directories so they don't get overwritten by any updates. I have the KiCadLibraries in my Documents folder so that macOS will iCloud sync automagically for me. You can do similar on other OS's.

Set the location of this folder in both the Manage Symbol Libraries and the Manage Footprint Libraries menu options from the Preferences menu.

If you are not sure about this, see [Install.md](Install.md)

These libraries may be included in the main set of KiCad libraries at a later point, at which time I'll look to see if there is a need to maintain this repro.
